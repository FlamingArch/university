      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
      known to harbor life. While large amounts of water can be found throughout
      the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of
      Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes
      and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of
      continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly
      moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes
      and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field
      that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.

      Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar
      energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is
      redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Water vapor is widely
      present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet.
      Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part
      of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. A region's climate is
      governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating
      oceans. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and
      heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.

      Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the
      densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the
      largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from the
      Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one
      revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in a day. Earth's axis of
      rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane with the Sun,
      producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite,
      the Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is
      roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with
      the same side through tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's
      axis and gradually slows its rotation.

      Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. During the first billion years of
      Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life
      spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface,
      leading to Earth's Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans
      emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of almost 8
      billion today. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources
      for their survival, but have increasingly impacted Earth's environment.
      Today, humanity's impact on Earth's climate, soils, waters and ecosystems
      is unsustainable, threatening people's lives and causing widespread
      extinction of other life.
