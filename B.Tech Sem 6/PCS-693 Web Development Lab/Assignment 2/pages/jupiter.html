      Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
      System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that
      of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less
      than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest
      natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. People
      have been observing it since prehistoric times; it was named after the
      Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.

      Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes
      one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky
      core of heavier elements,[16] but, like the other giant planets, Jupiter
      lacks a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing contraction of its
      interior generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun.
      Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid;
      it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer
      atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different
      latitudes, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries.
      A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm known to
      have existed since at least the 17th century when telescopes first saw it.

      Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful
      magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km (5.3 AU;
      500 million mi) long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit.
      Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly many more,[6] including the four
      large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa,
      Ganymede, and Callisto. Io and Europa are about the size of Earth's Moon;
      Callisto is almost the size of the planet Mercury, and Ganymede is even
      larger.

      Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest
      approach to the planet in December 1973.[17] Jupiter has since been
      explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the
      Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the
      Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995.[18] In 2007, the New
      Horizons visited Jupiter using its gravity to increase its speed, bending
      its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet,
      Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July 2016.[19][20] Future targets
      for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered
      liquid ocean of Europa.[21]
