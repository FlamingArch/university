      Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman
      goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's
      night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the
      naked eye in broad daylight.[18][19] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and
      so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west
      just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn. Venus
      orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[20] It has a synodic day length of
      117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a
      consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other
      planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all
      but Uranus. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.[21]
      Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury
      among the planets in the Solar System.[22]

      Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister
      planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and
      bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects.
      It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting
      of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's
      surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the
      pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is
      closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the
      Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is
      shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid,
      preventing its surface from being seen from space in light. It may have
      had water oceans in the past,[23][24] but these would have vaporized as
      the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.[25] The water has
      probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into
      interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary
      magnetic field.[26]

      As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture
      in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made
      sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for
      writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the
      first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the
      second millennium BC.[27]

      Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early
      interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited
      by a spacecraft (Venera 1 in 1961), and the first to be successfully
      landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venusian thick clouds render observation
      of its surface impossible in visible spectrum, and the first detailed maps
      did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans
      have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are
      hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions. The possibility of life on
      Venus has long been a topic of speculation, and in recent years has
      received active research.
